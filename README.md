# Slimy-Notes
### A simple and customisable notes application for Windows (Not tested on MacOS/Linux, and no build options are available)

## About
Slimy Notes is a simple yet customisable notes application for Windows primarily. It uses a popular WYSIWYG editor called TinyMCE to accomplish text styling and editing, but also has options of customising the entire note color for easier color coordination. The design is beautiful and sleek, yet very simple.

The application will remember every note and the state you left it in, so it's incredibly easy to quit the application when you're done, but then re-open only the things you want the next time.

## Downloading and Building
The application uses NodeJS + Electron, and can be build using `npm`. Simply download the project from GitHub, run `npm install` and then `npm run build`. The resulting application is then found under the `/dist` folder and can be placed anywhere!
